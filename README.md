# Inputs
Simple form inputs with basic validation hinting

The form validation takes place without any JavaScript and relies entirely on CSS hints, data-* tag attributes, and the output HTML element. The textarea is the only component which has any kind of JavaScript and this is for automatically resizing the box as content is entered. The form can be served without any client-side JavaScript.

A basic input form without any of the fields filled in.
